Description: Combined contour/heatmap plots, 3d bar/surface plots, 2d/3d triangular plots, isosurface plots and 2d/3d vector fields. By default, uses vector graphics, but it's possible to use raster graphics for regular heatmaps. Builds on the colorspace package (Zeileis, et al., 2020 <doi:10.18637/jss.v096.i01>), by supporting smooth multiband color interpolation, in sRGB, HSV and HCL color spaces.
